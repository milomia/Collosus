# RoRTest

Greetings, candidate. Welcome to Colossusbets Ruby on Rails test repository. Please read carefully the README before starting the test.

Good luck!

## How to use it

1. Fork this project into your own GitHub account. Do not clone this repository directly as you won't have push permissions.
2. Attempt all exercises. Please commit often and feel free to create/merge as many branches as you want.
3. Once you're done, send us your forked repository. We'll take the master branch as the final result.

## Notes

* You can assume all models have the canonical DB columns such as id, foreign keys, created_at and updated_at.
* Write your changes only where you'll find `# Your code here`. 
* `attr_accessor` have been used to highlight interesting non-standard DB columns in models, type of these columns is also shown as comment.
* You can add personal notes at the end of each test file (assumptions, alternative solutions, comments, ...)
